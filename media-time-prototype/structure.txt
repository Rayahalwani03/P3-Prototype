Debriefing (Last Page)
Thank you for taking part in this study.
The purpose of this experiment was to investigate how people perceive the passage of time when engaging with different types of media, such as video, audio-only content, and written text. Although each activity was similar in overall length, people often experience time differently depending on how engaging or immersive an activity feels.
During the study, you were asked to estimate how long each activity lasted and to report your level of engagement, attention, and immersion. These measures allow us to examine whether subjective time perception differs across media types and whether feelings such as immersion, enjoyment, or mind-wandering are related to over- or under-estimation of time.
Some aspects of the study were described in general terms at the beginning to avoid influencing your responses. This is a common and approved research practice when studying perception and experience.
Your responses will be analyzed anonymously and used only for research purposes. There are no right or wrong answers, and individual responses cannot be used to draw conclusions about any single participant.
If you have any questions about the study or would like further information, please contact the research team using the details provided by the experimenter.
Thank you again for your valuable contribution.
